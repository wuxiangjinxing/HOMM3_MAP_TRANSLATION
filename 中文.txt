Since The Stamp Act,The British government didn't stop trying to tax the colonies.	We were also told we had to pay high taxes on the tea. This tax was called the Tea Act.This didn't seem fair to the colonies as we were not represented in British Parliament and didn't have a say on how the taxes should be done.		
自《印花税法》颁布以来，英国政府一直试图向殖民地征税。我们还被告知，我们必须为茶叶缴纳高额税款。这项税收被称为《茶叶法案》。这对殖民地来说是不公平的，因为我们在英国议会中没有代表，对如何征税也没有发言权。
