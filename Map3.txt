"I know the case is desperate; but, sir, we must either quit the country or attack Mr. Hamilton. No time is to be lost. Were I sure of a reinforcement, I should not attempt it. Who knows what fortune will do for us? Great things have been affected by a few men well conducted. Perhaps we may be fortunate. We have this consolation, that our cause is just, and that our country will be grateful and not condemn our conduct in case we fall through. If we fail, the Illinois as well as Kentucky, I believe, is lost."--Clark wrote to Governor Henry

Genesis 6:4, "There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old men of renown." The giant offspring of this union between the sons of God and the daughters of men were called the Nephilim, who were known for their gigantic height. They spread from the Biblical Lands to Dinaric Alps ,the British Isles and the Ohio Valley.This giant race was called the Dinaric linked with the ancient Amorite Babylonian symbols and  advanced mathematics discovered by the Amorites .	Stonehenge and the many henges around the world may created by them.	This is a must explory for anyone who wants an affirmation of one of the most mysterious chapters in the Bible.	Now you arrive the highest area of Dinaric Alps ,having the chance to takes the leap from mythology to science--to discover that the Nephilim were the last vestiges of primitive species	But here once again,we may have some troubles.

Battle of Maip¨²-This battle left 2,000 Spaniards dead and 3,000 captured; the patriots lost about 1,000 men. The victory produced tremendous results. The victory brought an end to major Spanish operations in Chile. It also allowed the united Chilean and Argentine patriots to launch a series of attacks against Spanish positions along South America¡¯s Pacific coast, climaxing with the liberation of large parts of Peru from Spanish rule.	The historic victory is marked yearly every 5 April with a joint civil-military parade in Maipu, where the battle occurred (this day is Armor Day for the Chilean Army). A living history event at the last Sunday of April ends a month of national festivities in honor of the victory.

The two men could not come to an agreement, despite their common goals and mutual respect, even when San Mart¨ªn offered to serve under Bol¨ªvar.
Both men had very different ideas about how to organize the governments of the countries that they had liberated. Bol¨ªvar was in favor of forming a series of republics in the newly independent nations, whereas San Mart¨ªn preferred the European system of rule and wanted to put monarchies in place. San Mart¨ªn was also in favor of placing a European prince in power as King of Peru when it was to be liberated. 
 Bol¨ªvar proposed a toast to ¡°the two greatest men in South America: the general San Mart¨ªn and myself¡± (Por los dos hombres m¨¢s grandes de la Am¨¦rica del Sur: el general San Mart¨ªn y yo), whereas San Mart¨ªn drank to ¡°the prompt conclusion of the war, the organization of the different Republics of the continent and the health of the Liberator of Colombia

The encounter, fought in the context of the Spanish American wars of independence, pitted a Patriot army under General Antonio Jos¨¦ de Sucre against a Royalist army commanded by Field Marshal Melchor Aymerich.
The defeat of the Royalist forces loyal to Spain brought about the liberation of Quito, and secured the independence of the provinces belonging to the Real Audiencia de Quito, or Presidencia de Quito, the Spanish colonial administrative jurisdiction from which the Republic of Ecuador would eventually emerge.
